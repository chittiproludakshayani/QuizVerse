# Notes:
# - This manifest tells Render to create a static web service named `quizverse-static-site`
#   using the `site-upload` branch from your repository. Render will serve the files from
#   the repository root (staticPublishPath set to ".").
# - To complete deployment you still need to connect this GitHub repository to your Render
#   account and allow Render to access the repository. After linking the repo Render will
#   create the service automatically from this manifest (or you can create it manually and
#   Render will detect the manifest).
